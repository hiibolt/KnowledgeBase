# Graph
Non-empty set of vertices V with a set of two element subsets of V named set of edges E.
- ## Terms
	- ### Degree
	  Number of edges incident
	- ### Complete Graph
	  Every vertice has an edge to every other vertice
- ## Theorems
	- ### Handshaking Theorem
	  $\sum{degree} = 2* n_{edges}$
- ## Representations
	- ### Adjacency Lists
	  $P_1 : P_2, P_3, ...$
	  $P_2 : P_3, ...$
	- ### Adjacency Graphs
	  |  | P_1 | P_2 |
	  | P_1 | 0 | 1 |
	  | P_2 | 1 | 0 |

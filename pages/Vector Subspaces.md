## Definition
Let $V$ be a *vector space* and $\empty \ne W \subseteq V$. If $W$ is a vector space with respect to the operations in $V$, then $W$ is called a *subspace* of $V$. Every vector space has two subspaces $\{\vec{0}\}$ and $V$ itself.
- ## Determining Vector Space Validity
  **Theorem**: Let $V$ be a vector space with operations $\oplus$ and $\odot$. Let $W$ be a non-empty subset of $V$. Then $W$ is a subspace if and only if:
  * $W$ is closed under $\oplus$
  * $W$ is closed under $\odot$
- ## Common Subspaces
	- ### $P_2$ (polynomials of degree $\le 2$)
	  This is a subspace of $P_3$!
	  
	  Or, generally, $P_n$ is a subspace of $P_{n+1}$.

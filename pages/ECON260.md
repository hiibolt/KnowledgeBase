	- ### Everything is Scarce
	  * Labor (Human Resources)
	  * Capital (Machine/Mechanical Resources)
	  * Land (Natural Resources)
	  * Entreprenuership (Idea Resources)
	- ### Scarcity Forces Tradeoffs
		- ((65a6c57a-48c9-47f7-b2e6-3580f944f079))
		  The cost is not the monetary value (although it can be indirectly, potentially) but instead what you could have done with the money.
		  
		  Happiness is measured in utility or welfare.
	- ### Decisions are Made at the Margins
	  We assume that all individuals are **rational**.
		- ### Marginal Thinking
		  Comparing a raised price with the benefit you get from paying more.
		  
		  A choice is good if the **marginal cost (MC)** is less than or equal to the **marginal benefit (MB)**.
	- ### Institutions and Incentives Matter
	  Everything has an incentive.
- ## Opportunity Cost
  id:: 65a6c57a-48c9-47f7-b2e6-3580f944f079
  There is always a cost to make a choice - the **Opportunity Cost** is the value of what is given up.
  
  The opportunity cost is the value of the *top* option of things that you chose over.

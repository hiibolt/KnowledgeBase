## Base Assertations
	- ### Everything is Scarce
	  * Labor (Human Resources)
	  * Capital (Machine/Mechanical Resources)
	  * Land (Natural Resources)
	  * Entreprenuership (Idea Resources)
	- ### Scarcity Forces Tradeoffs

		  The cost is not the monetary value (although it can be indirectly, potentially) but instead what you could have done with the money.
		  
		  Happiness is measured in utility or welfare.
	- ### Decisions are Made at the Margins
	  We assume that all individuals are **rational**.
		- ### Marginal Thinking
		  Comparing a raised price with the benefit you get from paying more.
		  
		  A choice is good if the **marginal cost (MC)** is less than or equal to the **marginal benefit (MB)**.
	- ### Institutions and Incentives Matter
	  Everything has an incentive.
		- #### Free Market
		  Producers can create anything and sell it only to people who can pay the price.
		- #### Command and Control Market
		  Producers have a central authority that determines create something as outline by the CA and sell it by rules defined by the CA.
		- #### Mixed Markets
		  Many free market elements mixed with varying degrees of regulations by a central authority.
- ## Opportunity Cost
  id:: 65a6c57a-48c9-47f7-b2e6-3580f944f079
  There is always a cost to make a choice - the **Opportunity Cost** is the value of what is given up.
  
  The opportunity cost is the value of the *top* option of things that you chose over.
- ## Markets
  * There are **demanders**, or someone with a need
  * There are **suppliers**, or people with something to sell
  
  One of the key ideas is who and who cannot get the 'goods' that they want?

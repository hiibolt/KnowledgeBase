### Example
What is the probability that event $A$ will occur given that we already know $B$ has occurred?
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Reminder - to ensure valid data tables:
1.) You must verify that all probabilites are \ge 0
2.) You must verify that $\sum \text{probabilities} = 1$
- ## 'Given That'
  Given that a person is in B, what is the probability that they are also in A?
  $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
  
  And, when given that a person is in A, what is the probability that they are also in BB
  $$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}$$
  
  In short, *divide by the 'given that'*.

**Factor**: The number by which you multiply another to convert between another.
**Proportions**: If A is proportional to B, any factor increase to A is also applied to B.
* Simply divide the two variables to create a proportional law
**Precision**: A measure of the 'quality' of a measurement. Limited by the ultimate precision of the measurement device.
**Derived Unit**: Units that are a combination of multiple SI units.
- ## Significant Figures
  The number of accurately known digits plus one for estimation.
  * Non-0 = significant
  * Trailing zeros = significant
  * Zeros to the right of the decimal place (when abs() < 1) = not significant
  * Zeros to the left of the place when sequentially zero'd (IE: 200) *may* be significant. It's impossible to know without an identifier or scientific notation ($$2.00 * 10^2$$)
  
  *Rounding should only be done at the end of each calculation, even when converting units.*
  *Unit systems of factor 1 have infinite sigfigs.*

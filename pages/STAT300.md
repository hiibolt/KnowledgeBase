## Chapter 1
	- ### Definitions
	  * **Statistics** is the science of gathering data to help draw a conclusion based on said data
	  * **Population** is a collection of objects
	  * **Census** is a method of gathering that surveys *all* candidates.
	  * **Study/Sample Survey** is gathering information from a smaller subset of candidates.
	  * A **variable** is a characteristic that is variadic in nature. These use capital letters. For the actual data, use the lowercase equivalent of them.
	  * A **univariate, bivariate dataset** is a dataset consisting of just one and two variables respectively. A **multivariate dataset** is a dataset consisting of two or more variables.
	- #### Types of Variables
		- #### Quantitative 
		  A *measure* of something.
			- #### Discrete
			  Does not span a number line.
			- #### Continuous
			  Spans a number line in its entirety.
		- #### Qualitative
		  A *description* of something.
	- ## Graphs
		- ### Histograms
		  A graph of *quantitative discrete* data.
		  
		  The **relative frequency** of a data count $x$ with set size $n$ is $\frac{x}{n}$.
		  The **frequency** distribution is a table with three headers:
		  * *Data Type*
		  * *Frequency*
		  * *Relative Frequency*
			- #### Modality
			  A *unimodal* graph has one mode, a *bimodal* graph has two, *multimodal* graph has three, and a *uniform* graph has no model.
			- #### Skewing
			  A *skewed* graph leans either away from left or away from right, whereas a *symmetric* graph has similar left and right sides.

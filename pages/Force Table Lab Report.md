	- ## Primary Objectives
	  In this lab, we will...
	  * Calculate the **x** and **y** components of vectors
	  * Compute the equal and opposite force to a pair of vectors
	  * Calculate the error

- # Results
	- ## 3.1 Equilibrium Weight
	  First, I created a Desmos calculator to calculate the components of the final vector. **a** and **b** are the **x** and **y** components respectively of the first weight, and **c** and **d** are the **x** and **y** components of the second weight.
	  
	  **First two equations:**
	  These calculate the actual weight of each hook-weight system.
	  
	  **Equations 3-6:**
	  These calculate the **x** and **y** components of each system.
	  
	  **Equations 7-8:**
	  These two calculate the **x** and **y** components of the vector (the flip effect is not calculated, I do it manually to ensure my results are relevant.)
	  
	  **Equations 9-10:**
	  The first calculates the magnitude (N).
	  The second calculates the angle (deg), but 180 still needs to be added.

	- ## Percent Error
	  I calculated each percent error with the following formula:
	  $$\frac{true - measured}{true}*100\% \text{ = Percent Error.} $$

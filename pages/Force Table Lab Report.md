	  First, I created a Desmos calculator to calculate the components of the final vector. **a** and **b** are the **x** and **y** components respectively of the first weight, and **c** and **d** are the **x** and **y** components of the second weight.
	  
	  **First two equations:**
	  These calculate the actual weight of each hook-weight system.
	  
	  **Equations 3-6:**
	  These calculate the

	  This allows me to plug in the weight and angle of the weights and calculate the result.
		- ### Section 1:
		  I go ahead and plug in the angle and magnitude into the calculator.

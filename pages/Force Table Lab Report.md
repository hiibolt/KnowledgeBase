- # Results
	- ## 3.1 Equilibrium Weight
	  First, I created a Desmos calculator to calculate the components of the final vector. **a** and **b** are the **x** and **y** components respectively of the first weight, and **c** and **d** are the **x** and **y** components of the second weight.

	  This allows me to plug in the weight and angle of the weights and calculate the result.

## Definition
Extrema occur where the gradients of a boundary curve and some level curves are equal.

For a given extrema subject to the constraint $g(x,y) = 0$ at $(x_0, y_0)$, we can parameterize $g=0$ as $\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$.
Allowing $h(t) = f(\gamma(t)) = f(x(t), y(t))$ - $h(t) = 0, h'(t_0) = 0$ when $\gamma(t_0) = (x_0, y_0)$ gives us:
$$0=\frac{df}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{df}{dy}\frac{dy}{dt}$$

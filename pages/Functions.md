# Overview
A function \f from X to Y is a relation where every x \epsilon X there is a y \epsilon Y where (x, y) \epsilon \f
Set X is called the domain
Set Y is called the co-domain
	- ## Notation
	  R: A -> B (R \subset A x B)
	  **Used most frequently when relation R is a function.
	- ### Properties
	  - Injective
	  No repeated elements of Y.
	  - Surjective
	  If some a \epsilon A = b \epsilon B, f is surjective.
	  - Bijective

# Overview
A function \f from X to Y is a relation where every x \epsilon X there is a y \epsilon Y where (x, y) \epsilon \f
Set X is called the domain
Set Y is called the co-domain
	- ## Notation
	  R: A -> B (R \subset A x B)
	  **Used most frequently when relation R is a function.
	- ### Properties
	  * **Injective**
	  No repeated elements of Y.  ($$f( n ) = f( m )$$)
	  * **Surjective**
	  If some a \epsilon A = b \epsilon B, \f is surjective. Alternatively, if some b \epsilon B is not contained in the co-domain of f, itis not surjective.
	  * **Bijective**
	  If \f is both injective and surjective, \f is said to be bijective.
	- ### Composition
	  f: X -> Y, g: Y -> Z
	  Composition $g o f$: X -> Z is $(gof)(x) = g(f(x))$
- If for some $$f(x) = y$$, $x$ is the preimage of $y$ and $$y$$ is the image of $x$ under $$f$$.

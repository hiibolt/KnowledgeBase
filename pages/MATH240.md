### Refreshers
	- #### Spaces of Numbers
	  
	  $$\N \subset \Z \subset Q \subset \R \subset C$$
		- #### Notable Operations
		  * $+$ and $*$ work fine in all spaces.
		  * $-$ does not always work in $\N$
		  * $/$ does not work when dividing by zero
		- #### Notable Facts
		  A **field** (Q, $\R$, and $C$) guarantee a conjugate of every set element.
		- #### Example Equation
		  $$ax=b$$
		  
		  In this case, $ax$ is a **linear expression** in $x$.
			- #### Distributive Law
			  Consider that by the distributive law, this could also be $a\left(x+x^{^{\prime}}\right)$, or, $ax+ax^{^{\prime}}$.
			  
			  This **linear expression** can be notated as $L:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$.
			  
			  $$L_{a}\left(x\right)=ax$$
			  $$L_{a}\left(x+x^{^{\prime}}\right)=L_{a}\left(x\right)+L_{a}\left(x^{^{\prime}}\right)$$
			- #### Multiplicity
			  $$a\left(x\cdot x^{^{\prime}}\right)=\left(ax\right)x^{^{\prime}}=x\left(ax^{^{\prime}}\right)$$

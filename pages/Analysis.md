- # Textbook Analysis
	- ## Organization and structure
	  My course's textbook structure is less of a typical textbook and more of a teaching aid, meaning it's extra important to pay close attention in class when the teaching is mentioning the textbook. It's split into a unit-like structure versus a topological approach most textbooks take.
	- ## Primary Content
	  * Series (definite and finite)
	  * Linear and non-linear systems
	  ...
	  There's many more, but my teacher said not to read ahead as not everything in the textbook is actually covered in her class.

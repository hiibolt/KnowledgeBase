## General Definition
$$V = \int\int_D(f(x,y)-g(x,y))dA$$
- ### 7.1.E1
  Set up the integral for the volume of the solid bounded by the surfaces $z=x^2 + y^2$ and $z=2x$.
  
  Setting the two equal:
  $$x^2-2x+y^2=0$$
  $$\text{or}$$
  $$(x-1)^2 + (y + 0)^2 = 1$$
  
  Meaning $D$ is a circle of radius 1 centered at $(1,0)$.
  At this point, 2(1) >

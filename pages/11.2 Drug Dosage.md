## Model
$$\frac{dc}{dt}=-ke, k > 0$$
$$c(0)=c_0$$

Where
$c(t)$ is the concentration of the drug in the blood at time $t \geq 0$,
$H$ is the highest safe level of $c(t)$,
$L$ is the lowest effective level of $c(t)$,
$k$ is the elimination constant
and $c_0$ is the concentration of one dose.

We must now determine how much the dose should be and what the various periods (times) between the different doses are.

Case 1: (No repeated doses)
$$c(t)=c_0e^{-kt}$$

Case 2: (Repeated doses)
Where $c_0 = H$ (loading dose) and we must find T (the period between the doses)
$$T=\frac{1}{k}\ln{\frac{H}{L}} \geq 0$$

Case 3: (Repeated doses, residual concentrations)
\begin{cases}
c(t)=(R_1+c_0)e^{-k(t-T)}\\
c(t_0)=\dot c\\
\end{cases}
R_i = e( iT ), \text{ where }  i = 1,2,...

Looking between the times where $0 \leq t \leq T$:
$$R_1=c(T) = c_0e^{-kT}$$
Looking between the times where $T \leq t \leq 2T$:
$$c(T) = c_0 + R_1$$
$$\text{so}$$
$$c(t) = (c_0 + R_1)e^{-k(t-T)}$$
$$\text{and}$$
$$R_2 = C(2T) = (c_0 + R_1)e^{-k(2T - T)}=c_0(e^{-kT}+e^{-2kT})$$
Looking between the times where $2T \leq t \leq 3T$:
$$c(2T) = c_0 + R_2$$
$$\text{so}$$
$$c(t) = (c_0 + R_2)e^{-k(t-2T)}$$
$$\text{and}$$
$$R_3 = c(3T) = (c_0 + (c_0(e^{-kT}+e^{-2kT})))e^{-kT}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$=c_0(e^{-kT}+e^{-2kT}+e^{-3kT}$$

Generalizing:
$$c(t) = (c_0 + R_{n - 1})e^{-k(t-(n-1)T)}$$
$$R_n = c_0 * \sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-ikT}$$

Analyzing the end behaviour:
$$\lim_{n->\infty} c_0 * \sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-ikT}$$
$$\text{which is an infinite geometric series, so}$$
$$=c_0\frac{e^{-kT}}{1-e^{-kT}}$$
$$\text{alternatively}$$
$$=\frac{c_0}{e^{kT}-1}$$

We must now compute $c_0$, which can be done by considering that $R = L \text{ and }$

## Model
$$\frac{dc}{dt}=-ke, k > 0$$
$$c(0)=c_0$$

Where
$c(t)$ is the concentration of the drug in the blood at time $t \geq 0$,
$H$ is the highest safe level of $c(t)$,
$L$ is the lowest effective level of $c(t)$,
and $c_0$ is the concentration of one dose.

We must now determine how much the dose should be and what the various periods (times) between the different doses are.

Case 1: (No repeated doses)
$$c(t)=c_0e^{-kt}$$

Case 2: (Repeated doses)
Where $c_0 = H$ (loading dose) and we must find T (the period between the doses)
$$T=\frac{}{}$$

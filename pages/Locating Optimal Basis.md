## Proposed Replacement for the $1,x,x^2$ basis
By minimizing $a+bx+cx^2$ against $x^3$, we get $\left\lbrace1,\sqrt3(1-2x),\sqrt5(1-6x+6x^2)\right\rbrace$.

To find the new $a,b,\text{ and }c$ for $x^3$ over $\left\lbrack0,1\right\rbrack$ in this new basis, take the dot product of each basis vector and add them together multiplied by each of those basis vector.

For example:
$$\int_0^1{(x^3)(1)}dx(1)+\int_0^1(x^3)($$

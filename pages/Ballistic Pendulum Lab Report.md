- # Discussion
	- #### 4.1 Initial Velocity
	  I was tasked with finding the initial velocity first of only the ball being shot from the ballistic spring.
	  
	  I obtained the initial velocity by solving for V_o in the range equation ($$R=v_o\sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$$) to get and use the following equation.

	- ### 4.2 $K_E$ of the Ball/Cup Combined System
	  Next, I needed to find the velocity of the combined system once the ball collides with the cup.
	  
	  I do this with the formula $$v_i=\frac{m_bv_o}{m_b+m_c}$$, substituting $$v_o$$ from the previous step in as follows:
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1700001626316_0.png)
	  ...and next plugging this into the formula for kinetic energy ($$K_E = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)v_i^2$$)

	- ### 4.3 Height for Average Notches
	  I deduce the height for the average notches by **interpolation**, since no data point matches the average that we recieved.
	  
	  I used the following interpolation formula: $$\frac{x-n_1}{n_2-n_1} = \frac{y-h_1}{h_2-h_1}$$, and substituted in the average notches listed above in **Data 2.1**:

	- ### 4.4 Potential Energy at the Average Height
	  This was an interesting thing to find, as for our group, our potential energy was higher than our initial kinetic energy. We believe this is because we did not redo our range tests when we switched our ball after our ball wasn't pushing enough notches.
	  
	  I believe that if we had redone our range tests, our potential energy would have been less due to work done by friction of the pendulum hinge.
	  
	  Regardless, I calculated $$U$$ with the equation $$U=(m_1+m_2)gh$$, substituting in the values that we found as follows:

	- ### 4.5 Percent Difference
	  Percent difference is calculated using the standard formula $$\%_{diff} = \frac{K-U}{\frac{1}{2}. (K+U}*100\%$$

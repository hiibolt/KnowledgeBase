## Ordered Pair
An ordered pair $( a, b )$ becomes 
$$\{\{a\}\text{, }\{a,b\}\}$$
- ### Cartesian Product
  A * B = {(a, b): a $$\epsilon$$A and b $$\epsilon$$ B}
  
  Example: A = {1, 2}, B = {3, 4, d}
  * A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, d), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, d)}
	- ### Relation
	  Given sets A and B, relation R from A to B \subset of the Cartesian Product of A * B.
	  
	  A relation on a set S is a relation from S to S.
	  
	  To find all relations from C to D, list all subsets of A * B.
	  
	  The number of relations is $$2^{|A|*|B|}$$.
		- #### Notation
		  If (x, y) \epsilon R, then xRy.

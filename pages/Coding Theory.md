## Common Functions
``frac(x) = x - floor(x)``

Division Algorithm: ``n = qm + r``
* n = quotient
* m = devisor
* q = integer
* r = integer remainder (must be positive!)
- ### Congruence Classes
  For n mod 5:
  $[0]_5$ ="Numbers of form 5k"
  $[1]_5$ = Numbers of form 5k+1
  ...
  $[4]_5$ = "Numbers of form 5k+4": ${...-6,-1,4,9...\}$
  
  The equation $[4]_5$ = $[9]_5$ reads implies the congruence class of 4 modulo 5 is equal to the congruence class of 9 modulo 5. (or 4 triple hyphen 9 (modulo 5))
	- ### Congruence Arithmetic
	  $$[a]+[b] = [a+b]$$
	  $$[a][b] = [ab]$$

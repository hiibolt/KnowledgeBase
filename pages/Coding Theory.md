## Common Functions
``frac(x) = x - floor(x)``

Division Algorithm: ``n = qm + r``
* n = quotient
* m = devisor
* q = integer
* r = integer remainder (must be positive!)
- ### Congruence Classes
  For n mod 5:
  [0]_5="Numbers of form 5k"
  [1]_5 = Numbers of form 5k+1
  ...
  [4]_5 = "Numbers of form 5k+4": {...-6,-1,4,9...}

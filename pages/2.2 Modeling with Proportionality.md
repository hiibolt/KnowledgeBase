# Base Definition
Let $$x, y$$ be quantities. We say that _y is proportional to x_ $$(y \alpha x)$$ if $$y = kx \text{, where k } \neq 0$
	- ## Example
	  **How close to the car in front of us should we drive?**
	  
	  * **Rule 1**: Allow 1 car length (about 15ft) for each 10mph in speed "under normal road conditions"
	  * **Rule 2**: 2 seconds between cars
	  
	  
	  Rule 1:
	  $$\frac{15ft}{10mph}=(\frac{15ft}{52800ft})(\frac{1}{3600seconds})=\frac{45}{44} seconds ~= 1sec$$

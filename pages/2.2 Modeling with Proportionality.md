# Base Definition
Let $$x, y$$ be quantities. We say that _y is proportional to x_ $$(y \alpha x)$$ if $$y = kx \text{, where k } \neq 0$$
	- ## Example 1
	  **How close to the car in front of us should we drive?**
	  
	  * **Rule 1**: Allow 1 car length (about 15ft) for each 10mph in speed "under normal road conditions"
	  * **Rule 2**: 2 seconds between cars
	  
	  
	  Rule 1:
	  $$\frac{15ft}{10mph}=(\frac{15ft}{52800ft})(\frac{1}{3600seconds})=\frac{45}{44} seconds ~= 1sec$$
	- ## Example 2
	  **Predict the vehicle stopping distance in terms of its speed.**
	  
	  Total Stopping Distance: $$d$$
	  Reaction Distance: $$d_r$$
	  Braking Distance: $$d_b$$
	  
	  Full Equation: $$d=d_r+d_b$$

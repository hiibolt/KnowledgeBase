#### Who tanks the tax difference?
Whichever curve is **more inelastic** tanks the majority of the tax costs.

For instance, if the demand curve is more inelastic, the buyers will be paying the majority of the tax load.
If the supply curve is more inelastic, the sellers will be paying the majority of the tax load.

## Autonomous Differential Equations
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t,x) \text{ vs }\frac{dx}{df}=f(x)$$
Non-autonomous:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = smx+t$$
Autonomous:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = (x + 1)(x - 2)$$

Sometimes, it can be difficult to derive a solution. One of the best ways to still understand the behavior of a problem is visually, and by using geometric properties we can still analyze the qualitative behavior of a given problem.

## Autonomous Differential Equations
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t,x) \text{ vs }\frac{dx}{df}=f(x)$$
Non-autonomous:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = smx+t$$
Autonomous:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = (x + 1)(x - 2)$$

Sometimes, it can be difficult to derive a solution. One of the best ways to still understand the behavior of a problem is visually, and by using geometric properties we can still analyze the qualitative behavior of a given problem.

**Equilibrium Solution**:
$$\text{Let }\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$$
If $f(x^{*}) = 0$ for some $x = x^{*}$ (constant), then $x = x^{*}$ is a solution of $\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)$. 
Then, $x = x^{*}$ is called *equilibrium*, rest point, or steady state.
	- #### Example
	  $$\frac{dx}{dt}=(x+1)(x-2)$$
	  
	  Equilibrium solutions: $x = -1, 2$
	  
	  Our next step is to identify the x-intervals where $\frac{dx}{dt} > 0$ and $\frac{dx}{dt} < 0$. This can be done via a critical number line.
	  
	  $$-\infty < x < -1: \oplus $$
	  $$-1 < x < 2: \ominus $$
	  $$2 < x < \infty: \oplus$$
	  
	  Our next step is to identify the x-intervals where $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} > 0$ and $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} < 0$.
	  $$\frac{dx}{dt}=x(t)^2-x(t)-2$$
	  $$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{dx}{dt}=2(x(t))(\frac{dx}{dt})-\frac{dx}{dt}$$
	  $$\text{so}$$
	  $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=(x+1)(x-2)(2x-1)$$
	  Our critical points are at $x = -1, 2,\text{ and }\frac{1}{2}$
	  
	  $$-\infty < x < -1: \ominus $$
	  $$-1 < x < \frac{1}{2}: \oplus $$
	  $$\frac{1}{2} < x < 2: \ominus $$
	  $$2 < x < \infty: \oplus$$
	  
	  With this information, we may now graph 2/\infty of our ADE.
		- ## Classification
		  An equililbrium $x=x^{*}$ is _stable_ (S) if any solution curver that starts close to it converges to $x = x^{*} as $t\rarr\infty$.
		  
		  An equilibrium $x=x^{*}$is _unstable_ (NS) if there exists a solution curve that starts close to it, but movers away as $t \rarr \infty$.
		- ## Process of Graphing
		  1.) Graph each POI and equilibrium solution as a horizontal curve
		  2.) Using the sign of increasing/concavity curves, draw a few solutions
		  3.) Classify equilibrium solutions as either stable or unstable
	- ## Example
	  Graph representative solutions in the 1st quadrant of $(t,p)$ plane for $\frac{dP}{dt}=k(M-P)P$ where $k, M > 0$, $t\geq 0$ as time, $P \geq 0$ as population
	  
	  **Equilibrium Solutions**
	  $$0 \leq P < M: \$$

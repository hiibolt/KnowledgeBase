## Definition
A vector field is **conservative** if it is the gradient of some differentiable function $f$, that is, $F = \nabla f$.
- ### Example 10.1.E
  Take a smooth planar curve $$C(t) = (x(t),y(t))$$ for $$a \leq t \leq$$, then partition $$[a,b]$$ $$n$$ ways with $$a=T_0<t_1<t_2<...<t_n=b$$ and choose sample points $$t_i^{*}\in [t_{i-1},t_i]$$. Then take

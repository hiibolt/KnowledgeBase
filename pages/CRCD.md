## Responsibilities
	- ### Frontend
	  CRCD would like a replacement for their current internal systems which they use for monitoring, which has many flaws such as intermittent and often non-existent reports.
	  
	  Must be able to monitor all jobs, whether they are active, and who is active when. This will likely be monitored based on commands run in a given interval.
	  
	  It's important that we create an interface that has role-based delegation. For instance, on a student level, they would only be able to see activity they generated. The PI (program investigator?), however, would be able to see all of their student's activity, on top of their own. A CRCD employee must be able to see all available information at any given point.
	- ### Project Management
	  I'll be in charge of (or assist?) with handling student affairs. Currently, CRCD is unhappy with the fact that many of the researching students have never met eachother.
	  
	  This means students are missing out on many key benefits of working with others, such as real-time engagement, human connection, and the ability to bounce ideas off of and learn from others.
	  
	  My lead mentioned that he has a location (block 51 in the library, I believe?) where he would like to orchestrate student meetings. I will be in charge of creating a forum (it was unclear whether this was a physical forum, connotation, or an electronic message board) to be able to better facilitate engagement between students.
	  
	  There will, of course, be many challenges such as scheduling. But hey, that's why it's a job!
	- ### Backend
		- ### Macro
		  There are many things that he mentioned. I believe it was a combination of the above (namely, the frontend)
		- ### Micro
		  It seems that CRCD is currently not confident that the system will be able to handle the scaling required for a growing user base. They would greatly like to avoid queue times for jobs, and one of the best ways to do so is to ensure that jobs which are submitted are run as fast as humanly possible.
		  
		  They are interested in [XDMOD](https://open.xdmod.org/11.0/index.html), which appears to be a profiling/heat-mapping application for the system. They would like the user to also be able to profile their applications to ensure that they are utilizing the absolute maximum efficiency on Metis.
		  
		  It's also worth noting that CRCD seems to be generally not confident in the stability of Metis as a system after Gaea (which may or may not have been retired). It's worth looking into ways to gauge this or ensure stability.

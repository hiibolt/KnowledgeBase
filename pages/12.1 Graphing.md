## Base Problem
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,y)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x,y)$$

Equilibrium Solution:
\begin{cases}
f(x^{*},y^{*}) = 0\\
g(x^{*},y^{*}) = 0
\end{cases}

Note:
$(x^{*},y^{*})$ is (S), (AS), and (NS).

Graphing in the $(x,y)$ plane (phase plane) trajectories:
*Note 1: For each point, there is only one trajectory, and we'll graph them in parallel*
*Note 2: Only the equilibrium *

## Base Problem
Trout and bass in a pond, compete for resources. Determine the long-term outcome and coexistence, at least one will become extinct. How is the outcome related to the initial population?

Let $x(t)$ be the trout population at $t \geq 0$.
Let $y(t)$ be the bass population at $t \geq 0$.

**Assumptions**:
For the trout **without** the bass ($a > 0$), the rate of change per individual is:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax(t)$$

For the trout **with** the bass ($a > 0$) the rate of change is reduced by $bxy$.

## Base Problem
Trout and bass in a pond, compete for resources. Determine the long-term outcome and coexistence, at least one will become extinct. How is the outcome related to the initial population?

Let $x(t)$ be the trout population at $t \geq 0$.
Let $y(t)$ be the bass population at $t \geq 0$.

**Assumptions**:
For the trout **without** the bass ($a > 0$), the rate of change per individual is:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax(t)$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = my(t)$$

For the the two models **with** the bass ($a > 0$) the rate of change is reduced by $bxy$:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy \text{ where }a,b >0$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = my - nxy \text{ where } m, n > 0$$
	- ### Deriving the equilibrium solutions:
	  \begin{cases}
	  \frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy = x(a - by)\\
	  \frac{dy}{dt} = my - nxy = y(m - nx)
	  \end{cases}
	  \begin{cases}
	  (1) | x(a - by) = 0\\
	  (2) | y(m - nx) = 0
	  \end{cases}
	  $$\text{so}$$

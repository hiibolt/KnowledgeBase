## OSI Model
Layers are organized into levels of increasing complexities. This means that lower-level layers are specific to the medium, and higher-level layers are specific to the application.
	- ### Application
	- ### Presentation
	- ### Session
	- ### Transport
	  Adds the "room number", where you can multiplex a connection into individual ports.
	- ### Network
	  This introduces the idea of a global address. This primarily is where IP addresses are implemented.
	- ### Data link
	  Hardware address for the system. Typically interfaced via Ethernet, and the address is better known as the MAC address.
	- ### Physical
	  Primarily handled by modems (shorthand for modulator/de-modulator).

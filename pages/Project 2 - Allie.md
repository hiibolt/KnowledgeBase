## Introduction
In this project, we will be deriving variations of a predator-prey model that typically is modeled by the following model:

**Owls vs. Hawks** (Competing species in same environment)
$$\Delta O_n = k_1O_n-k_3O_nH_n$$
$$\Delta H_n = k_1O_n-k_3O_nH_n$$
Explanation of variables and constants:
* $\Delta O_n$: Change in owl population between generations*
* $\Delta H_n$: Change in hawk population between generations*
* $k_{1-4}$: Positive constants
* $$

## Review for Exam 1
* **Bubble (Sinking)**: Every pass, each pair of two numbers, and swap the larger to be the second
* **Selection**: Every pass, place the smallest element at the start of the array
* **Insertion**: (First Pass): Create an array with the first element. For each next pass, pick the next element, and place it into the array in its correct position. At the end, you will have a completely sorted array.
* **Quick Sort (Partition Type 1)**: Pick a pivot value (middle value). Come from the left until you find a value larger than the pivot. Then, come from the right, and pick a value less than the pivot. Swap them. When the two searches intersect, pick the smaller of the two intersects, and swap it with the pivot value. Then, call the quick sort recursively on the arrays left and right of the old pivot value.

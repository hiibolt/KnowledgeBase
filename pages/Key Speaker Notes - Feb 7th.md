- ## Introduction
	- ### Introducing Structured Data
		- #### Spatial Structured Data
		  Represents both entity attributes and their interactions/relations with each other
		  
		  **Examples**: Molecular network, Internet Network
		- #### Temporal Structured Data
		  Models sequential features and optimizes long-term rewards
		  
		  **Examples**: Game playing, treatment trajectory, human-machine interaction
	- ### Weakly-Supervised Learning
	  Deep neural networks required a *ton* of labeled data for training.
	- ### Iterpretability of machine learning models
	  Interpreting what is learned by the DNN is critical for evaluation.

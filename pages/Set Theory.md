# Set
Collection of elements
	- ## Set Notation
	  collapsed:: true
	  $$\{ E_1, E_2, ... E_n \}$$
	  * No duplicates
	  * Can be finite or infinite
	  * Denominated with bracket enclosures, such as $$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}$$
	  * More often than not denoted by capital English letters
	  
	  Two sets A and B are both subsets and super sets of one another.
	  Therefore, to prove that set A and B are equal, you can check that A is a subset of B (B contains all elements of A), as well as that B is a subset of A (A contains all elements of B).
		- ### Operators
		  $\epsilon$ = contains
		  \cup = union
		  \cap = intersection
		  $|S| \text{ or } \#S$ = cardinality
		- ### Common Sets
		  * $$\Z = \{ x : x \text{ where }x \text{ is an integer }\}$$
		  * $$\R = \{ x : x \text{ where }x \text{ is a real number (including 0)}$$
		  * $$Q = \{ x : x \text{ where } x \text{ = }\frac{p}{q} \text{ and } p, q \epsilon \R\}$$
		  * $$N = \{ x : x \text{ where } x \epsilon \Z \& x > 0 \}$$
		- ### Empty Set
		  $$\phi = \{\}$$
		  For any given set S: $\phi \subset S$
		  For any given element E: $$E \notin \phi$$
		  Also, $$\phi \subset \phi$$ and $$\phi \notin \phi$$

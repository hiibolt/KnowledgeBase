## Fit a linear model with a, b as parameters
|x|x_1|x_2|x_n|
|y|y_1|y_2|y_n|

The vertical differences between $P_i (x_i, y_i)$ and L is:
$$|y_i-f(x_i) = |y_i-ax_i-b|$$

This makes the absolute deviations:
$$y_i-f(x_i)-residuals$$

The line L which is closest to all (x_i,y_i) i = 1,2,...n could be found
* L (or a, b) minimize the sum of absolute deviations
* L (or a, b) minimizes the largest absolute deviations

$$P_1 (x_1, y_1)$$
$$Q_1 (x_1, ax_1+b)$$

Which makes the difference between the two:

$$= \sqrt{(x_1-x_1)^2+(y_1-ax_1-b)^2}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$=|y_1-ax_1-b|$$

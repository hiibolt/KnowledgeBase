# Qualitative Analysis
**Example**:
Owls and hawks compete for the same food, no other species are present.

Let $$x_i$$ be the population of owls on day $i$.
Let $$y_i$$ be the population of hawks on day $i$.

In a day's time:
$$\Delta x_i = x_i-x_{i-1}$$
$$\Delta y_i = y_i-y_{i-1}$$

$$\Delta x_i =k_1 x_i-k_3x_{i-1}$$
$$\Delta y_i = k_2y_i-k_4y_{i-1}$$
Where:
$$x_i$$ = the population of owls on the ith day
$$y_i$$ = the poplutaion of owls on the ith day

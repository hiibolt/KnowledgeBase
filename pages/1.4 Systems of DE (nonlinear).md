# Qualitative Analysis
**Example**:
Owls and hawks compete for the same food, no other species are present.

Let $$x_i$$ be the population of owls on day $i$.
Let $$y_i$$ be the population of hawks on day $i$.

In a day's time:
$$\Delta x_i = x_i-x_{i-1}$$
$$\Delta y_i = y_i-y_{i-1}$$
$$\Delta x_i =k_1 x_i-k_3x_{i-1}$$
$$\Delta y_i = k_2y_i-k_4y_{i-1}$$
$$\text{Where...}$$
$$x_i\text{ = the population of owls on the ith day}$$
$$y_i\text{ = the population of owls on the ith day}$$

$$K_{1,2,3,4} > 0$$
*Note: The system is nonlinear because of the second term.*

While the solution is not solvable for without graphing the values as they are created with Excel, etc, you can still find the equilibrium solution.
$$x_i = x$$
$$y_i = y$$
$$\text{For all i = 1,2, ...}$$
$$\Delta x_i = 0$$
$$\Delta y_i = 0$$
$$\text{For all i at equilibrium.}$$

Solving the algrebraic system created by this knowledge:
$$0 = k_1x-k_3xy$$
$$0= k_2y - k_4xy$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$E_1 = 0 = x(k_1-k_3y)$$
$$E_2 0 = y(k_3-k_4x)$$
$$\text{and}$$
$$E_1 \text{ implies that }x = 0\text{ or }k_1-k_3y = 0$$
$$E_2 \text{ implies that }y = 0\text{ or }k_2-k_4y =0$$
$$\text{so}$$

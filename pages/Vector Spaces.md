#### General Definition
A collection of vectors, where there exists one zero vector. 
Each vector $v$ has a sibling $sv$ (where $s$ is some scalar).
Each vector pair $u,v$ must produce another vector $u+v$.
- ### Basis Vectors
  A choice of n vectors $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{n}$. It may be that an arbitrary vector $v$ can be written as $v=s_1,b_1+,\cdots,+s_{n}b_{n}$. In which case, vector _spans_ the vector space.

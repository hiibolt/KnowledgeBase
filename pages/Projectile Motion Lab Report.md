- # Data
	- ## 2.1 Part A
	  | Distance | Height |
	  |0cm|27.6|
	  |2cm|27.5|
	  |4cm|27.3|
	  |6cm|27.0|
	  |8cm|26.7|
	  |10cm|26.4|
	- ## 2.2 Part B
	  **Distance Between Photogates:** 76.0cm
	  **Time To Cross Photogates:** 0.41s
	  **Velocity:** 1.85 $$\frac{m}{s}$$
	  **H_0:** 79.1cm
	  
	  Our photogates were damaged and hence unusable, so we borrowed data from another group according to our TA.
	  
	  Expected Range: $$R=(1.85)\sqrt{\frac{2(79.1)}{9.80}}=0.74$$
	  Actual Range:
	  | Trial # | Distance (cm) |
	  |1|51.0|
	  |2|51.3|
	  |3|52.6|
	  |4|52.8|
	  |5|53.1|

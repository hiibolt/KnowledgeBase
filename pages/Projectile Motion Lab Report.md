	- ## Percent Error
	  I calculated each percent error with the following formula:
	  $$\frac{true - measured}{true}*100\% \text{ = Percent Error.} $$
- # Discussion
  I was first tasked with calculating the **x** and **y** components of each weight. I did this by first adding the mass of the weight and hanger together, converting to **kg**, and converting to Newtons.
  
  Next, I multiply by the cosine and sine of the angle of the weight (relative to the +x axis) to get the **x** and **y** components.
  
  Following this, I am tasked with finding the components of the equivalence vector. I do this by simply adding the **x** and **y** components, then taking the square root of both squared added to get the magnitude. I find the angle by taking $$arctan(\frac{y}{x})$$ and adding 180.
  
  Finally, I calculate the percent error using the above formula.
  
  
  In my case, I created a calculator to streamline my work. I believe that the masses were not accurate, which contributed to the errors.
- # Conclusion
  This was a very fun lab. I enjoyed being able to physically see equations in motion, even if there was some error.
  
  The only thing I would change would be to provide an explanation for said error in the final result, whether it be an excerpt in the manual or a full section dedicated to the concept.

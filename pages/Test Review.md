## Horse Problem
	- ### Assumptions
	  * All horses are geometrically similar.
	  * All horses have the same density.
	- ### Equations
	  $$V\propto l^3$$
	  $$V\propto W$$
	  $$\text{so}$$
	  $$V\propto W\propto l^3$$
	  $$W=kl^3$$
	- ### Example
	  We are given one horse to be 4ft tall and weighs 800.
	  
	  From this, we can derive k:
	  $$800=k(4)^3$$

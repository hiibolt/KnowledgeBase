## Definition
Used to help define universal traversal for advanced data structures - particularly useful for non-contiguous ones.

There are also some data structures that cannot be iterated over without modifying it, such as a `stack` container.
- ### Common Methods
	- #### `begin`
	  Returns an instance of `Iterator` that points to the start of the data structure
	- #### `end`
	  Returns an instance of `Iterator` that points to the end of the data structure

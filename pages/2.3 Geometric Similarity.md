## Key Definition
Two objects A and B are geometrically similar ($A ~ B$) if there is one-to-one correspondence between the points of A and B such that the ration of distances between corresponding points is constant $k>0$

(A ~ B) implies that A and B have the same shape.

	  Let S_1 and S_2 be the total surface areas of A and B respectively:

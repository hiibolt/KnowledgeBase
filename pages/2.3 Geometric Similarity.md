## Key Definition
Two objects A and B are geometrically similar ($A ~ B$) if there is one-to-one correspondence between the points of A and B such that the ration of distances between corresponding points is constant $k>0$

(A ~ B) implies that A and B have the same shape.

Therefore, $k > 0 = \frac{R}{r}=\frac{H}{h}=\frac{W}{w}$.
	- ### Surface Area
	  Let S_1 and S_2 be the total surface areas of A and B respectively:
	  $$\frac{S_1}{S_2}=\frac{\pi*R^2+\pi*R*L}{\pi*r^2+\pi r e}=\frac{(kr)^2+kr*kl}{r^2+re}=k^2$$
	  so...
	  A ~  B => $S_1 \propto S_2$ with constant of proportionality $k^2$.
	  
	  This allows $\frac{S_1}{S_2}=k^2=(\frac{R}{r})^2$ and $\frac{}{}$
	- ### Volume
	  $$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{\frac{1}{3}\pi R^2H}{\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h}=\frac{(kr)^2kh}{r^2h}=k^3$$
	  so...
	  A ~  B => $V_1 \alpha V_2$ with constant of proportionality $k^3$.

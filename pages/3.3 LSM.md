## Data points $(x_i,y_i) \text{ where } i = 1,2,...n$ fit the model $y=f(x_1,a_1,a_2,..a_k)=f(x)$

Choose $a_1,a_2,..a_k$ so that $y_i$ are as close as possible to $y_i=f(x_i)$.

**Example**:
Consider the linear function $y=ax+b$, what are $a$ and $b$? Data points $(x_i,y_i) \text{ where }i=1,2,...n$ are given.

As long as the function is differentiable, you can derive $a$ and $b$ by finding where $\frac{\rho s}{\rho a}=\frac{\rho s}{\rho b}=0$. Next, we will need to obtain the linear system and solve for $a$ and $b$.

$$S(a,b) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-ax_i-b)^2$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$=\sum_{i=1}^{n}2(y_i-ax_i-b)(-x_i)$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$=2\sum_{i=1}^{n}{-i_ix_i+ax_i^2+bx_i}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}{}$$

- First day - # of BBL of each grade that must be delivered
  Jan 1st - Hunting barrels that would move or be moved in Feb (3 weeks).
  On the 25th of each month, we have to formally tell the pipeline companies how many BBLs of each grade we will move or recieve
- Getka takes in .25% sulfer and has 39 degree gravity, 200k BBLs/day
- Blending 4 - 6 different type of crudes to make a Domestic Sweet Barrel to run at a Phillips 66 Refinery in Bartlesville.
- Domestic Sweet Barrel must be approximately 42 degree gravity and less than .42 % Sulphur content.
- Attached is a diagram of the two terminals that we will be receiving crude into:
	- **BEE Truck Terminal** - 7 Truck unloading stations and a 80,000 barrel crude tank.
	- **P-66 Buxton Terminal** - 1 - 150,000 bbl crude tank and a 250,000 bbl crude tank
- ### Distances
	- The **BEE Truck Terminal (Getka)** is approximately 1 mile from the **P-66 Buxton terminal** and is connected to **P-66 Buxton Terminal** by the **O-Line** crude pipeline.
	- The **P-66 Buxton Terminal** is connect to the **Phillip’s Refinery** by the **Cush - Bo** pipeline.
- Terminals and Pipelines that we will be receiving crude from:
	- P-4 / L2 Connection from Energy Transfer (North Cushing)
	- Magellan Terminal
	- Plains Terminal
- BATCH’s of CRUDE
	- WCS crude or (Western Canadian Select Crude) is delivered into P-66 Buxton 150,000 bbl tank in 10,000 bbl batches from Plains.
	- **P-66 Lease Crude 55 degree gravity** is delivered daily pro ratable at 4,700 bbls per day from **Plains terminal** into **P-66 Buxton** 150,000 tank.
	- **NIO Crude** is delivered into **BEE Terminal** from the **P4 / L2** pipeline in 50,000 bbl batches.  Then it will move from **BEE terminal** into **P-66 Buxton** via the **O-Line** interconnect at what ever rate you need it.
-
- M-V Condensate is moved by trucks into the BEE Terminal via the truck unloading stations. Then it will move from BEE terminal 	into P-66 Buxton via the O-Line interconnect at what ever rate you need it.
-
- Heavy Skim Oil is moved by trucks into the BEE Terminal via the truck unloading stations. Then it will move from BEE terminal 	into P-66 Buxton via the O-Line interconnect at whatever rate you need it.
- BLENDING OPERATIONS OF THE CRUDE
- All
  Crude will be received into the P-66 150,000 bbl tank to be blended. 
  One we meet Specifications 42 Gravity and less that .42 percentage 
  Sulphur the Domestic Sweet bbl will be transferred into the 250,000 bbl 
  tank for staging and then will be moved to 	Phillips 66 Refinery in 50,000 bbl batches.

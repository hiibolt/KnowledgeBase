  Today I'd like to commemorate him for being my inspiration to teach others, continue my education in the fields which he taught me, and to give my all in all areas which interest me.

I turned in my assignments early and played games for the rest of the class. He, however, wasn't having that. Unbeknownst to me, he slowly started giving me harder and harder assignments, and it wasn't until I asked a classmate for his answer only for him to have a comparatively

She helped for the sake of helping others, she did not seek social benefit.

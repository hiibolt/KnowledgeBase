## Attention Getter
Today, I'd like to commemorate, of all people, my Computer Science and Mathematics teacher. I beefed with a lot of my high school teachers, but there's nobody on this planet I've beefed with harder than than him.
- ## Central Idea and Main Points
  Today I'd like to commemorate him for being my inspiration to teach others, continue my education in the fields which he taught me, and to give my all in all areas which interest me.
- # He is my inspiration to teach others
	- In highschool, I was the only freshman in AP Computer Science.
	- As a result of the intense stress of her childhood, my mother's immune system collapsed and she was ill for much of my own childhood. However, this didn't stop her from taking care of us - it didn't matter if she was coughing blood, she home schooled us from her bedside and took us where we needed to be at the cost of her own health.

	- My mother was an incredibly gifted person, but she was not one to flaunt it. Despite her upbringing, she graduated as class valedictorian from high school and received her four year degree from Stanford University with a perfect GPA - but it's not something she'd tell you unless you asked. She was always one to ask a million questions to learn something about you rather than share about herself.

	- It didn't matter who you were to my mother, if you needed help, she was there for you. Her friends described her as the 'closest thing to an angel'. She volunteered at counter organizations, churches, and schools. She never told anyone where or why she was volunteering unless they asked, but that's because she didn't need to. She helped for the sake of helping others, she did not seek social benefit.

## Attention Getter
"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others" is one of Gandhi's most well-known quotes, and I've never met anyone that represented lived that quote like my mom did.
- ## Central Idea and Main Points
  Today I'd like to commemorate my mom for the amazing person she was. She was a loving mother, a humble champion, and a pure altruist.
- # She was a loving mother
	- My mother was not given the right to a happy upbringing. She was raised by a cruel woman diagnosed as a malignant narcissist - often regarded as the most unpleasant type of humans alive. Despite being subjected to the mind games of a cruel parent, she chose to break the cycle and sought to be everything for my family her mother was not.
	- As a result of the intense stress of her childhood, my mother's immune system collapsed and she was ill for much of my own childhood. However, this didn't stop her from taking care of us - it didn't matter if she was coughing blood, she home schooled us from her bedside and took us where we needed to be at the cost of her own health.
- # She was a humble champion
	- My mother was an incredibly gifted person, but she was not one to flaunt it. Despite her upbringing, she graduated as class valedictorian from high school and received her four year degree from Stanford University with a perfect GPA - but it's not something she'd tell you unless you asked.

## Attention Getter
Today, I'd like to commemorate, of all people, my Computer Science and Mathematics teacher. I beefed with a lot of my high school teachers, but there's nobody on this planet I've beefed with harder than than him.
- ## Central Idea and Main Points
  Today I'd like to commemorate him for being my inspiration to teach others, continue my education in the fields which he taught me, and to give my all in all areas which interest me.
- ## He is my inspiration to continue my education
	- In HS, I was the only freshman in AP Computer Science. He and I had beef from the start because I didn't want to be there. I turned in my assignments early and played games for the rest of the class. He, however, wasn't having that. Unbeknownst to me, he slowly started giving me harder and harder assignments, and it wasn't until I asked a classmate for his answer only for him to have a comparatively easy assignment. This meant war, so I started to obfuscate my answers. This basically meant that, while my code worked, it took significantly longer for him to grade. 
	  
	  In retrospect, he won that war. He got me to do more work than I would have otherwise, and got me to learn more about CS in the year that he taught me than any other time in my life.
- ## He inspired me to teach
	- I actually never confronted him until my fourth year, in which he was my AP Calculus teacher. I asked him why he did that for me, and if I was the only one who he did it to. His answer was simple. "It doesn't matter if you were or weren't. I only did it because I knew you could." This is an answer that's stuck with me since, because there was no reason for him to do this.
	  
	  He was a teacher that valued actual teaching, and having been subject to it, I've since been inspired to teach robotics and coding. I've been volunteering as an instructor at United States Engineering League for over a year.
- ## He taught me to give my all to everything I enjoy
	- In his Calculus class, he often urged students to join the math team. He'd say "There's no point in being good at something if you don't try to improve or use that skill!", and I now agree. There's no point in being good at something if you don't pass that skill on or use it. He was able to convince me to join the competitive math team and the VEX robotics team, both of which I have lifelong memories from.
- ## Conclusion
  To conclude, I'd like to urge you to be him for someone else. It doesn't need to be huge, but if you're good at something, using that talent to inspire and teach may change someone's life!

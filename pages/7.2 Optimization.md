## Example
\begin{cases}
f(x_1,x_2) = x_1+x_2\\
2x_1+3x_2 \leq 6\\
x_1, x_2 \geq 0
\end{cases}
Our extreme points are A, B, and O.

**Theorem**:
If the feasible region is non-empty, bounded and converse set, then the linear objective function assumes both its max and min values at some extreme point of the feasible region.

*Note*: The max or min of a linear program will occur at an extreme point. To find the max or min values we need to find the extreme points.

By applying this thereon, we must test the three extreme points.

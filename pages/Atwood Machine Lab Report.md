	- ## Primary Objectives
	  In this lab, we will...
	  * Measure the relationship between mass difference between a two-weight pulley system
	  * Calculate little G by the trendline of the relationship between weight difference and time
	  * Calculate the error percentages between a calculated and measured value
- # Data
	- ## 2.1
	  Weight 1: 118.2
	  Weight 2: 119.1g
	  Pulley: 465g
	  Distance between photogates: 64.5cm
	  
	  | Weight - Mass 1 (g) | Weight - Mass 2 (g) | Time (s) |
	  | 50 | 75 | 1.448311 |
	  | 45 | 80 | 1.264709 |
	  | 40 | 85 | 1.0909185 |

- # Results
  First, I decided to format my data as follows in a ``data`` variable:
	- ## 3.1 Calculating Acceleration
	  I achieve this by first adding the mass of the weights themselves and converting to kilograms. Next, I populate the ``weight_difference`` field, and finally I calculate and populate the ``acceleration`` field.

## Definition
For two continuous curves $x, y$ defined on an interval I, the following parameter $$t$$ equations describe a parametric curve:
$$x=x(t)$$
$$y=y(t)$$

Alternatively: $$\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$$

For an interval I(\alpha, \beta), \alpha is the **initial point**, and \beta is the **terminal point**.

$$C(t) = \gamma (a + b -t)\text{ for }a \leq t \leq b$$
Is a reversal of the **orientation** of the parametric curve, meaning $$C(a) = \gamma(b)$$.

A **closed curve** is considered where $$\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)$$.

A **double traversal** is where you complete the bounds twice, etc.

Flipping the bounds often flips the direction of the parametric.
- ## Eliminating the Parameter
  Functions might not need to be represented parametrically, typically functions that pass the vertical line test.
  
  $$\gamma(t) = (a\cos(t),b\sin(t))$$

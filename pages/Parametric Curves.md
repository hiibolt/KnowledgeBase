## Definition
For two continuous curves $x, y$ defined on an interval I, the following parameter $$t$$ equations describe a parametric curve:
$$x=x(t)$$
$$y=y(t)$$

Alternatively: $$\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))$$

For an interval I(\alpha, \beta), \alpha is the **initial point**, and \beta is the **terminal point**.

	- ## 2.1 Estimating How Many People Work in the Willis Tower
		- ### 1. Starting with the length and width of the ground floor provided, calculate the total area in meters.
		  Length = 450ft
		  Width = 450ft
		  
		  With this information, we can calculate the area in $$\text{ft}^2$$:
		  $$450\text{ft} * 450\text{ft} = 202500\text{ft}^2$$
		  
		  However, we need the area in meters:
		  $$202500ft^2*(\frac{12in}{1ft})^2*(\frac{2.54cm}{1in})^2*(\frac{1m}{100cm})^2=19000m^2$$
		- ### 2. Use Figure 1 to estimate how much of the space that you calculated is actually usable. 
		  I estimate roughly only $$\frac{14}{18}$$ of the first floor is actually usable.
		  
		  Therefore, we can calculate the usable area as follows:
		  $$19000m^2*\frac{14}{18}=15000m^2$$
		- ### 3. Use Figure 2 to estimate the amount of floors in each section of the building and calculate the total available surface area in the building. 
		  
		  For the sake of the problem, I will assume that parts of the building *not* visible are eliminated/present via any symmetrical chunks.
		  
		  I will split each set of like floors into their multiplied 'actual available area'. I will also assume only a third is actually 
		  $$15000m^2 * (50 * \frac{9}{9} + 20 * \frac{7}{9} + 30 * \frac{5}{9} + 20 * \frac{2}{9}) * \frac{1}{3} = $$
		  
		  4. Estimate the size of a cubicle that a person would need to work comfortably and efficiently.
